# Semi-Supervised-Co-Analysis-of-3D-Shape-Styles-from-Projected-Lines
This is a submission code for SIGGRAPH ASIA 2017

-----------------------------INTRODUCTION-----------------------------------------------
In this small program, We've provided a mixed models set which contains 30 models of 
two style in directory 'all_model'.

-------------------------------ENVIRONMENT--------------------------------------------------
1. MATLAB 2016a, Visual Studio 2013, OpenGL should be installed.

-------------------------------QUICK DEMO--------------------------------------------------

1. Run Easy_run.m in matlab (Label-constrainted style clustering.) You can get
   purity of the clustered result and the location about style patches.

2. Run back_projection.exe under fold 'Showstyle_exe'. 

3. You can find images which show the style patches located on all shapes in the directory 'style_patch'.
